# Robot CANControl Project

Robot CANcontrol is a free and open source robotic development software stack. The project has been under development at the University of Melbourne in partnership with Fourier Intelligence for use with their X2 exoskeleton. The software has been designed to be extensible to any embeeded linux and CANopen enabled Robotic platform.

## The Robot CANcontrol project is made up of:

- Abstract robot framework to flexibly represent most multi body robotic systems.
- Event driven State machine to develop custom applications for your Robot.
- Implementation of [Canopen Socket](https://github.com/CANopenNode/CANopenSocket) to provide an interface between CAN enabled embedded linux system and Canopen configured motor drivers/sensors.
- Documentation
- Fully functional application examples.
