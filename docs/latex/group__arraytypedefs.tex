\hypertarget{group__arraytypedefs}{}\doxysection{Global array typedefs}
\label{group__arraytypedefs}\index{Global array typedefs@{Global array typedefs}}
\mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_eigen}{Eigen}} defines several typedef shortcuts for most common 1D and 2D array types.

The general patterns are the following\+:

{\ttfamily Array\+Rows\+Cols\+Type} where {\ttfamily Rows} and {\ttfamily Cols} can be {\ttfamily 2},{\ttfamily 3},{\ttfamily 4} for fixed size square matrices or {\ttfamily X} for dynamic size, and where {\ttfamily Type} can be {\ttfamily i} for integer, {\ttfamily f} for float, {\ttfamily d} for double, {\ttfamily cf} for complex float, {\ttfamily cd} for complex double.

For example, {\ttfamily Array33d} is a fixed-\/size 3x3 array type of doubles, and {\ttfamily Array\+X\+Xf} is a dynamic-\/size matrix of floats.

There are also {\ttfamily Array\+Size\+Type} which are self-\/explanatory. For example, {\ttfamily Array4cf} is a fixed-\/size 1D array of 4 complex floats.
