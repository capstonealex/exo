\begin{DoxyTemplParams}{Template Parameters}
{\em T} & the numeric type at hand\\
\hline
\end{DoxyTemplParams}
This class stores enums, typedefs and static methods giving information about a numeric type.

The provided data consists of\+: \begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A typedef {\ttfamily Real}, giving the \char`\"{}real part\char`\"{} type of {\itshape T}. If {\itshape T} is already real, then {\ttfamily Real} is just a typedef to {\itshape T}. If {\itshape T} is {\ttfamily std\+::complex$<$\+U$>$} then {\ttfamily Real} is a typedef to {\itshape U}. \item A typedef {\ttfamily Non\+Integer}, giving the type that should be used for operations producing non-\/integral values, such as quotients, square roots, etc. If {\itshape T} is a floating-\/point type, then this typedef just gives {\itshape T} again. Note however that many \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_eigen}{Eigen}} functions such as internal\+::sqrt simply refuse to take integers. Outside of a few cases, \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_eigen}{Eigen}} doesn\textquotesingle{}t do automatic type promotion. Thus, this typedef is only intended as a helper for code that needs to explicitly promote types. \item A typedef {\ttfamily Literal} giving the type to use for numeric literals such as \char`\"{}2\char`\"{} or \char`\"{}0.\+5\char`\"{}. For instance, for {\ttfamily std\+::complex$<$\+U$>$}, Literal is defined as {\ttfamily U}. Of course, this type must be fully compatible with {\itshape T}. In doubt, just use {\itshape T} here. \item A typedef {\itshape Nested} giving the type to use to nest a value inside of the expression tree. If you don\textquotesingle{}t know what this means, just use {\itshape T} here. \item An enum value {\itshape Is\+Complex}. It is equal to 1 if {\itshape T} is a {\ttfamily std\+::complex} type, and to 0 otherwise. \item An enum value {\itshape Is\+Integer}. It is equal to {\ttfamily 1} if {\itshape T} is an integer type such as {\ttfamily int}, and to {\ttfamily 0} otherwise. \item Enum values Read\+Cost, Add\+Cost and Mul\+Cost representing a rough estimate of the number of C\+PU cycles needed to by move / add / mul instructions respectively, assuming the data is already stored in C\+PU registers. Stay vague here. No need to do architecture-\/specific stuff. \item An enum value {\itshape Is\+Signed}. It is equal to {\ttfamily 1} if {\itshape T} is a signed type and to 0 if {\itshape T} is unsigned. \item An enum value {\itshape Require\+Initialization}. It is equal to {\ttfamily 1} if the constructor of the numeric type {\itshape T} must be called, and to 0 if it is safe not to call it. Default is 0 if {\itshape T} is an arithmetic type, and 1 otherwise. \item An epsilon() function which, unlike \href{http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/numeric_limits/epsilon}{\texttt{ std\+::numeric\+\_\+limits\+::epsilon()}}, it returns a {\itshape Real} instead of a {\itshape T}. \item A dummy\+\_\+precision() function returning a weak epsilon value. It is mainly used as a default value by the fuzzy comparison operators. \item highest() and lowest() functions returning the highest and lowest possible values respectively. \item \mbox{\hyperlink{namespaceinternal_a1476c0ff29b0937a7c35710ae0625761}{digits10()}} function returning the number of decimal digits that can be represented without change. This is the analogue of \href{http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/numeric_limits/digits10}{\texttt{ std\+::numeric\+\_\+limits$<$\+T$>$\+::digits10}} which is used as the default implementation if specialized. \end{DoxyItemize}
