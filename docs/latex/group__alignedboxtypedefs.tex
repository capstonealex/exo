\mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_eigen}{Eigen}} defines several typedef shortcuts for most common aligned box types.

The general patterns are the following\+:

{\ttfamily Aligned\+Box\+Size\+Type} where {\ttfamily Size} can be {\ttfamily 1}, {\ttfamily 2},{\ttfamily 3},{\ttfamily 4} for fixed size boxes or {\ttfamily X} for dynamic size, and where {\ttfamily Type} can be {\ttfamily i} for integer, {\ttfamily f} for float, {\ttfamily d} for double.

For example, {\ttfamily Aligned\+Box3d} is a fixed-\/size 3x3 aligned box type of doubles, and {\ttfamily Aligned\+Box\+Xf} is a dynamic-\/size aligned box of floats.
